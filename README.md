# Ray-Tracing-3D-Engine

A Ray Tracer in C, based on the ray tracer by Caleb Piercy AKA gth759k
    (https://sourceforge.net/u/gth759k/profile/)

I recoded his raytracer in C and added some basic game controlls and physics
    (https://sourceforge.net/projects/rasterrain/)

I'm trying to port it to OpenGL
